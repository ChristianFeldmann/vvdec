 * bool eof = false;
 * uint8_t *data = NULL;
 * int length = -1;
 * while (!eof)

 *     data = get_nal_unit_data();
 *     length = get_lenght_of_nal_unit_data();
 *     eof = is_this_the_last_nal_unit();
 *   }
 *
 *   bool new_picture, check_output;
 *   if (libvvcdec_push_nal_unit(decCtx, data, length, check_output) != LIBVVCDEC_OK)
 *     handle_the_error();
 *   if (!new_picture)
 *   {
 *     // The NAL was consumed and the next NAL can be pushed in the next call to libvvcdec_push_nal_unit
 *     data = NULL;
 *     legth = -1;
 *   }
 *
 *   // Next, check the output
 *   if (check_output)
 *   {
 *     libvvcdec_picture *pic = libvvcdec_get_picture(decCtx);
 *     while(pic != NULL)
 *     {
 *       // Do something with the picture...
 *       int width = libvvcdec_get_picture_width(pic, LIBVVCDEC_LUMA);
 *       // Go to the next picture until no more pictures are present.
